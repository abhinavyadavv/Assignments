    "\n",
    "*In OOP, classes can be organized hierarchically, where a new class (the derived or child class) can inherit the characteristics of an existing class (the base or parent class).*\n",

    "**2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their differences and advantages.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "**Single Inheritance:** *Single inheritance occurs when child class inherits only a single present class*\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "*Single inheritance is simpler and more straightforward to implement.It is commonly used when a class needs to extend the functionality of another class.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reduced Ambiguity: Since there's only one parent class, there are no ambiguities in method or attribute resolution. It's clear where a particular method or attribute is inherited from.*\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Multiple Inheritance:** *In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from multiple base classes. This means that a child class can have multiple parent classes.*\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reusability: Multiple inheritance enhances code reusability. A class can inherit features from multiple parent classes, allowing it to combine functionalities from different sources.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Flexible Design: Multiple inheritance provides flexibility in class design. Developers can create complex class hierarchies that accurately model real-world relationships and behavior.*\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ambiguity:Multiple inheritance can lead to ambiguity issues when two or more parent classes define methods or attributes with the same name.However,In single inheritance, there is no issue of ambiguity when two or more parent classes define methods or attributes with the same name because there's only one parent class.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Complexity: Multiple inheritance can introduce complexity and make code harder to understand if not used carefully.However,In Single inheritance is simpler and easier to understand because a child class inherits from only one parent class.*  \n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Class:** *It is also known as a parent class or superclass, a base class is the class whose attributes and methods are to be inherited by other classes. It serves as a blueprint for creating derived classes.It is not required to inherit from any other class and is at the top of the inheritance hierarchy.*\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Members with the `protected` access modifier are not directly accessible from outside the class, but they can be accessed within the class and its subclasses (derived classes).*\n",
